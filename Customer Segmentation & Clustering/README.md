# Shopping Customer Segmentation
In this unsupervised machine learning project, I [clustered customers](https://github.com/ndomah/Nilesh-Data-Portfolio/blob/main/Customer%20Segmentation%20%26%20Clustering/Shopping%20Customer%20Segmentation.ipynb) based on their [shopping data and demographics](https://github.com/ndomah/Nilesh-Data-Portfolio/blob/main/Customer%20Segmentation%20%26%20Clustering/Mall_Customers.csv) to better understand the target for marketing activities. 

![clusters](https://github.com/ndomah/Nilesh-Data-Portfolio/blob/main/Customer%20Segmentation%20%26%20Clustering/clustering_bivaraiate.png)

- The target group is cluster 1 which has a high spending score and high income
- 60% of cluster 1 shoppers are women; We should look for ways to attract these customers using a marketing campaign targeting popular items in this cluster
- Cluster 2 presents an interesting opportunity to market to the customers for sales event on popular items
