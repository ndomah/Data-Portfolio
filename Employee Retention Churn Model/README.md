# Employee Retention Churn Model
I built an Auto ML model trained on previous data that can predict if new employees will leave. 

Using the Google Cloud platform, I:
- Created and manipulated databases in [BigQuery](https://github.com/ndomah/Nilesh-Data-Portfolio/blob/main/Employee%20Retention%20Churn%20Model/bigquery2.png)
- Built the model in [Google Colab](https://github.com/ndomah/Nilesh-Data-Portfolio/blob/main/Employee%20Retention%20Churn%20Model/Pilot_Analysis_Employee_Churn.ipynb)
- Built the dashboard in [Looker Studio](https://lookerstudio.google.com/reporting/c31ad2aa-1202-4bd0-8271-b70de439f543)
