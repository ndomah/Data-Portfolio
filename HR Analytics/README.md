# Using Analytics to Drive Employee Incentives and Wellness
In this project, I:
- Built a database
- Developed [SQL queries](https://github.com/ndomah/Nilesh-Data-Portfolio/blob/main/HR%20Analytics/HR%20Analtyics.sql) to answer analytical questions
- Connected the database to Power BI
- Bulit a [dashboard](https://github.com/ndomah/Nilesh-Data-Portfolio/blob/main/HR%20Analytics/HR%20Analytics%20Dashboard.pbix) based on a [wireframe](https://github.com/ndomah/Nilesh-Data-Portfolio/blob/main/HR%20Analytics/Wireframe.png). 

The goal was to provide a list of healthy individuals & low absenteeism for a companys healthy bonus program.
